## Contributing

Contributions from others are welcome. Code health and user health are the uncompromising priorities so please ensure submitted code is:

1. Readable: Can other engineers understand the meaning of the code without significant difficulty?
2. Maintainable: Can engineers keep the code working and make changes as needed without breaking production?
3. Testable: Can the correctness of the code be determined by an automated test?
4. Consistent: Does the code respect the conventions, designs and patterns of the surrounding code?
5. Durable: Does the code solve a long term problem and prevent the need for constant refactoring/redesign?
6. Respectful: Does the code avoid unnecessary offense and promote inclusion for all engineers? Read [Google respectful code guidelines](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/respectfulcode) for more information.

Code will be accepted once it has been determined to reasonably meet these criteria via code review.
