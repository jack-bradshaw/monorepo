# Monorepo

_One Repo to rule them all, One Repo to find them, One Repo to bring them all and in the darkness
bind them._

This codebase contains all code written by Jack Bradshaw from 2022 onwards. It is structured as a
monorepo and uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build) as the build tool. Everything is covered by the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) except the contents of [third_party](third_party) which are explicitly exempt from the
license and are provided according to the terms set forth by their authors.

## Setup

After cloning the repository you must complete the following steps:

1. Install the JDK (version specifics in [bazelrc](.bazelrc)).
1. Install the Python SDK with C headers (version specifics in [MODULE.bazel](MODULE.bazel)).
1. Install the Android SDK (version specifics vary depending on which package is being built).
1. Copy [local bazelrc](local_bazelrc) to your home directory and configure it according to the
   instructions in the file.

Once these steps are complete you will be able to build and test code on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Structure

This codebase contains various projects with dependencies connecting them together, and it
generally follows a flat hierarchy with minimal nesting. The top level projects are:

1. [KLU](java/klu) (Kotlin Lightweight Upgrade): General helpers and utilities for Kotlin.
1. [KMonkey](java/kmonkey): Kotlin tools for the JMonkey game engine.
1. [Otter](java/otter): An experimental (and incomplete) game engine.

Various pieces of build/test infrastructure also exist including:

1. [Presubmit](presubmit): System for continuous integration.
1. [Formatting](formatting): Tools for keeping the codebase consistently formatted.
1. [AutoFactory](autofactory): Integrates Google autofactory with Bazel.
1. Bazel Config: These files are generally near the root of the project and make Bazel work.

README files are distributed throughout the repository. View them for more granular information.

## Building/Testing

Build all code by running `bazel build //...` and test all code by running `bazel test //...`. View
the granular packages for further build/test information.

## Versioning

The repository is versioned by the current date, with the version defined in the [MODULE.bazel](MODULE.bazel) file,
and since the repository contains multiple projects the version is updated whenever any project
is released in any way.

TODO(jack-bradshaw): Create an automatic version update system.

## Releasing

View the granular packages for further release information.

TODO(jack-bradshaw) create a repository wide release system.

## Contributing

Please read and follow these guidelines if you wish to make contributions.

### Priorities

Prioritise the following:

1. Code quality.
2. User experience.

Priorisiting code quality generally means providing documentation, optimising for maintainability
and readability, always writing tests, taking time to refactor when code has grown beyond its
original scope, following language/platform/framework conventions, and adhering to engineering
best practices. If you are unsure about a change, simply consider the experience of the
maintainer after you have moved on, and if you wouldn't want to be that person, improve the code
now.

TODO(jack-bradshaw): Explain what prioritising the user experience means.

## Presubmit

Submissions to main are automatically verified by a presubmit system which build all code and runs
all tests. On Github it runs automatically when code is pushed and when PRs are opened/updated, and
under normal circumstances it absolutely must pass before any code can be merged. Exceptions are
granted only when the presubmit system itself is broken. Presubmit is started by running
`bashpresubmit/presubmit.sh`.

WARNING: Presubmit may modify the working directory during execution, so commit/stash all changes
before running to avoid lost work.

## Documentation

Store all important documentation in the repository itself to prevent code becoming detached from
important documentation. This applies to design docs, one-pagers, and other ancillatory paperwork.
Use markdown where possible.

## Vendoring

All external dependencies are vendored for hermetic security and reliability. When changing Bazel
deps or package manager deps (maven etc) follow these steps before submission:

1. Re-vendor all required dependencies using `bazel vendor //...`
2. Ignore any dependencies containing files exceeding 100MB (limitation imposed by GitHub).
3. Commit the dependencies.

TODO(jack-bradshaw): Write a presubmit to check all deps are vendored.
TODO(jack-bradshaw): Migrate off GitHub and delete the large file limit.

## Large Files

All files must be stored directly in the repository and not in supplementary storage, meaning Git
LFS, Git Annex, and all other such tools are banned. So far this has only results in two large
vendored deps being ignored, and migration to a self-hosted Git repository is in progress to work
around GitHub's 100MB limit.

TODO(jack-bradshaw): Migrate off GitHub and delete the above comment.

## Code of Conduct

This repository does not have a code of conduct, but please do not behave in a way that warrants the
creation of one. Regulating human behavior rarely ends well, and nothing can be said that isn't
already covered by the principles of kindness and compassion. If you are unsure about an action or
inaction, ask before acting.

There is currently no CLA.
