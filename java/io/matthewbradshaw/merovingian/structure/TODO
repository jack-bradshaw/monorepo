put some basic game items in here

go top down and bottom up

top down:

multilevel game: multiple world items, one at a time, exposes a controller for switching between them
single level game: just a single world item
continuous: multiple world items, dynamically loads them

bottom up:

atomic: a singular object in the world with no complex behavior
cluster: a group of other objects with no geometry of its own
room: hosts other objects, and has its own geometry

also need to work out how the player will be structured
