# About Wrong Perspectives on an Art Gallery

You find yourself standing in a completely red room. Bright red. Inescapable. Everywhere. Not small
as to be claustrophobic, but encroaching in another way. How do you feel?

I imagine some people might feel they are in Hell, others might cry for help, and some would search
for a weapon. This brings us to [graphic 1](/static/content/gallery/panic.png).

If the torture is eternal though, time is limitless, and eventually you find art, the only possible
coping mechanism for such an existence, which brings us to perspective, the fundamental basis of
subjectivity. This brings us to
[graphic 2](/static/content/gallery/multitude_wrong_perspectives_art_gallery.png).

This image contains numerous wrong perspectives on an art gallery, beginning with the physical which
shows skewed walls and angles that don't quite add up, and followed by paintings on the walls which
themselves show the same room from five distorted perspectives, within each of them various minor
details which further disrupt the harmony, a few meta comentaries about the state of the physical
space, a critique of perspective itself, and a few organic elements for joy.

I hid a few others there too but don't have time to list them, maybe you can find them...
