We are all born judging. It’s in our nature and is a natural part of humanity. Judgment, by its very
nature, is a comparison between what we know to be true and what we see to be true. It’s an approach
to conflict which seeks to destroy and refine until only a pure truth remains. It should come as no
surprise that it dominates society given how much support it lends to individual pursuits and
institutional stability. Judging helps us stay grounded in facts and reason. Yet it also builds
walls around our hearts and eventually draws us away from the very truth it seeks to uphold.

Contrast this with understanding.

None of us are born understanding. It’s in our nature but requires a conscious effort and commitment
that does not come naturally. To understand is to actively put aside our preconceptions, beliefs,
and truths, so that space can be made for new ideas and perspectives. Where judgment seeks
consistency and a complete picture of everything, understanding permits subjectivity and gives rise
to the beauty of multiple perspectives. A drive to deep understanding is the essence of the curious
spirit which sees walls of unrelenting knowledge, and asks, what is beyond here? What else don’t we
know yet? What might we learn? Might something beyond our knowledge one day crumble to reveal
greater truths we have yet to even consider? We aren’t born understanding, but we can learn to
pursue it.

Understanding and judgement are not enemies though. Just as the walls which imprison us hold back
the elements, judgement shields us from obvious lies as much as it keeps us from exploring the green
fields of free thought. To judge is to seek safety and refuge in the known, and to understand is to
risk losing that which we hold to be dear.
