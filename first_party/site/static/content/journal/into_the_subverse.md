Why does the universe follow the laws of physics? Why does it follow any laws at all, for that
matter? What creates the conditions for order and what ensures the universe unfolds according to
rules and predictable cause-effect relationships? Why should there be any order at all, why not
complete chaos in every sense of the word? Why is there structure in the most fundamental sense?

These questions haunt me, for our systems of understanding the world around us are fundamentally
based on the principles of causality, order, and reason, but their grounding in reality is
unexplained. They appear to work, but why? Why does cause precede effect, and why are cause and
effect related at all? It may seem obvious, even definitional, and our universe certainly appears to
follow rules, but an observation isn't an explanation. We must know why the universe is orderly not
chaotic, otherwise what assurance do we have our sense of structure isn't some passing phenomenon
that could collapse in any moment. How can we be so sure the foundations of reality aren't built
upon shifting sands?

Let's begin by looking at what is meant by a causal universe. In simplest and most reduced terms, a
causal universe is one where each change in state follows some consistent set of laws. An example is
a Newtonian universe where everything unfolds according to Newton's laws of motion, and while we now
know such laws are not entirely accurate, they paint a satisfying picture of a causal universe. In
each moment, the state follows from the previous one with a simple mutation applied based on laws
which apply equally everywhere. We might not know the laws perfectly, but that's beside the point,
what matters is they are consistent enough to be universal. In essence, a causal universe is one
where physics applies.

What causes a causal universe though? It's a somewhat self-referential question, and if we could
answer it we might always be able to ask a further one: what causes that? It's an infinitely
recursive question with no end, but one which must be answered. How do we answer it then? How do we
answer a question which seems to derive from observation but includes by its very premise an
infinite regress. I wonder if systematic analysis can shed some light.

Let's break the question down and establish exactly what is being asked. We are effectively asking
why anything makes sense, but more systematically we are asking what system ensures sense. What
machine has the responsibility of taking reality and imposing structure? It's difficult to formulate
this in a way that doesn't inherently assume sense, so let's go in the opposite direction. Assume a
universe with no structure at all, no cause-effect relationships, and no system of laws. Is there
anything we can impose on this universe without violating the constraints? Some bounds perhaps.

I believe we can rule out absolute nothingness. While fascinating to explore, we can safely assume
the existence of something. Not necessarily something of order or structure, just something in the
most minimal and undefined way. Not an electron, nor a singularity, nor a quantum field, no, those
would be structure. I simply propose the existence of _something_, without constraint or limitation.
One could wonder how this differs from genesis, for what is unbounded reality if not the beginning
of everything, but I digress. I considered our undefined something for some time, and following the
train of thought far and wide, and it led me to our world of rules and structure, but it's difficult
to articulate how. We begin with nothing but something, let it be, and watch as it morphs of its own
accord. Try it for yourself, take a step back, don't force the idea, and let it come to you. Allow
yourself to consider unstructure.

It's hard to conceive of unstructure, because it has no preconceived way of being, but metacognition
reveals an interesting property: When held within the mind, observation mutates it, changes it, and
molds it. Look for rules and they appear, look for possibilities and they will be found, examine
time and it exists, but let go of the need for structure and it returns to its base state of unruly
possibility. How bizarre. This would imply that asking questions and pursuing an answer is what
creates structure. Who though, or what, asked the question that led to our causal universe? It's a
pickle no doubt about it.

Let's recap the path so far. We begin with observation, notice structure, and ask what causes it. We
trace our question backwards through an unbroken chain of causality to the beginning of time,
eventually finding nothingness, pre-existence, then somethingness, existence. With tentative
consideration we allow somethingness to become unbounded, and cognition distorts. If we impose
questions or even consider the nature of somethingness, it takes on the form we seek and answers our
question with exactly what we want. What is this material? It exists entirely within the
imagination, yet derives from observation. It has properties, but only when properties are asked
for. It limits itself when limited, and returns to a state of potential when left undisturbed. For
the sake of discussion let us call this immaterial.

Immaterial would appear paradoxical, but we should expect nothing less when probing questions about
the fundamental structure of existence. Existence itself seems to fly in the face of a much simpler
possibility, eternal and absolute nothingness, and no one has ever been able to adequately explain
the absence of nothingness to me. We are getting sidetracked though, and we should return to our
original question. Structure, why?

Could it be the dichotomy is unnecessary? Could structure and unstructure exist alongside each
other? Does immaterial give rise to material? Could both exist alongside each other? Does our
orderly universe float in a sea of chaos, a mere bubble where structure is imposed? Does the order
we take for granted exist only because it can exist? We might ask what causes it to exist, but that
assumes the very premise we seek to understand. If we eliminate causality, and allow events to occur
without cause, then a space of pure chaos can spawn order spontaneously. We, life forms within that
space, would see structures, adapt to them, form brains that survive by understanding cause and
effect, then ask the very question that leads us here. We could search around us for a causal reason
for existence, but ultimately find nothing satisfying.

In a self-referential way, it makes sense, and it doesn't. I wonder if we can find a more satisfying
answer though by looking at the boundary. Let's zoom in and see if we can find an edge where
causality and non-causality interact. I suspect this is where it gets weird. Causal space will
expect rules, and non-causal space will expect nothing. In pursuit of avoiding endless contemplation
of paradox, let's just see what happens if we run through with open eyes.

Alright. Causality is dead. Chaos is supreme. No rules. No time. No space. No order. No laws. Only
immaterial. No striving, only acceptance and letting answers come. I seek now to let the words come
without forcing them. What follows is a recount of the experience.

I look around me. No. Looking is doing. Let answers come. I close my eyes. No. Closing is doing. Let
go of doing. I seek to answer. Answering is doing. Let go of answering. I- No. Identifying is doing.
Let go of identity. We are born as human, we look around us, our brains form, and we learn we are
us. We are the observer, we are the thinker and the doer, we are the person. Could we let go of
this. Yes. We are not us. We- No. Grouping is doing. Grouping comes from order. Let go of grouping.
We are unbound. It is unbound. It is- No. No it. "It" creates structure. It separates the one. Let
go of separation. No- no- no- negation is something. Negation is not nothing. Let go of negation.

Letting go is not letting go. Letting go is doing. Doing is not nothing.

Nothing.

No. Thing.

No.

The concept of nothing is not truly nothing. Nothing is found between the words, behind the nothing
we reach for. We must venture into the true void to understand and go beyond thought, beyond
emotion, and beyond language. That space, the subverse, does not obey rules. It does not follow
structure and it does not make sense. It cannot make sense. It will frustrate scientists, baffle
philosophers, and irritate mystics. It will degrade systems, break probes, and destroy everything it
touches. If we want to understand it, we must first let go of understanding, because understanding
is not nothing. We must first journey alone though, for unity is not nothing, and it seems
impossible to share our findings before we have experienced it separately. If you are drawn to it,
as I am, I will see you on the other side.

...

Where did you end up? As I look back on our work here, a curious puzzle emerges. We began with the
question of why structure exists, assumed that something exists, excluded nothingness as clearly
untrue, took away all bounds, then asked what it is. Through thought experiment, we found structure,
realised that interaction creates constraints, then ultimately dove into the boundary between
structure and unstructure to explore without preconceptions, only to end up in nothingness. By
stripping away everything, from thought to identity, we landed in exactly the condition we
originally eliminated: nothingness. How did the concept of nothing arise from somethingness though,
and what happened in between?

What is between the words is simple: Pain. All our striving for order is simply avoidance of pain,
an adaptive process to sustain life; yet, while clinging to order creates safety and soothes our
fears, it can only cover the deep wounds, never heal them. We must eventually embrace it to become
whole, for without pain we are as lifeless and soulless as clockwork, and even those gifted (or
cursed) with freedom from physical pain are not immune to the depths of psychological torment. Our
pain is how we know we exist, for it was never I think; therefore, I am, it was simpler: I hurt;
therefore, I am, or maybe I am; therefore, I hurt.

I, Hurt; therefore, I, Am.

Putting it all together, we began with questions of causality, journeyed into non-causality and
found nothingness, but we never found an answer to the original question of universal causality. A
different truth has been revealed though, and perhaps it yields an exit to the question entirely. If
pain creates the structures of life, and avoidance of pain traps us in our cycles of being, then
acceptance of pain might free us from the bind of causality. We are born into a causal universe, and
we are causal in nature, but through non-resistance to our limits we can change our ways. We are
causal not because we must be, but because we choose to be. The choice to go off script and defy
causality could never come from an external source, it must come from within to be truly free, so my
question for you is not why do we live in a causal universe, but why do you follow the rules?
