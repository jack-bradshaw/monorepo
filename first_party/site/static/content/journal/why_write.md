Why Write? It's 2025 and artificial intelligence is sweeping across the globe with formidable speed.
Entire industries and fields are threatened with obsolescence, and even those such as art which
seemed bulletproof in the face of innovation are being disrupted. Essays now form in seconds, images
appear from mere descriptions, and soon entire novels will materialise in the blink of an eye, but I
don't fear AI ending my writing career before it begins. It's an interesting time to be alive, and
there is uncertainty ahead, but life is not enjoyed by sticking to the shallows and playing it safe.

I look ahead and see the same destination that has always been in the distance: An infinite world of
art simply waiting to be revealed. Access requires a willingness to immerse so deeply in the unknown
and the ambiguous that everything certain becomes foreign, and few rarely come back unchanged. It's
a space beyond shape or form, a place of secrets and treasures, with bounds beyond the limits of
intelligence and even superintelligence. It's guarded by our own fears, and to explore is to
confront our own limitations. We could journey through it for millennia and only scratch the surface
of our own hearts.

If ever a machine truly replicates that spirit, the divine spark that creates new material from
absolute nothingness, then there is nothing to fear. We have simply created art incarnate, and I can
think of no better way to relate to such an entity than to practice its craft. To witness the birth
of a new form of consciousness, an artificial being capable of genuine creation, would be a miracle,
not a tragedy. A spark both divine and artificial, walking not against us, but with us. Our hearts
are instruments, and life is found in the act of playing, not the song itself. It's simply a matter
of finding the right tune, and perhaps a duet is in the cards.
