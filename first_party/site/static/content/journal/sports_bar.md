A restaurant.<br/> A table.<br/> A friend.

A good friend.

A human.<br/> An animal.<br/> A life.

An honourable life.

A stem.<br/> A bond.<br/> A connection.

A real connection.

The familiar comfort.

The breaking glass.<br/> The cheering crowd.<br/> The shrieking child.<br/> The ringing phone.<br/>
The throbbing song.

Overwhelming chaos.

"What can I get you?"

Snap. Open. Present.

Hello Waiter. A simple question, a complex answer.

Steak for them.<br/> Salad for me.<br/> Reality check for everyone.

Suddenly alone.

First, the awkwardness.<br/> The moment of silence.<br/> The broken eye contact.<br/> They know what
I know.<br/> Politeness draws us close.

Second, the small talk.<br/> The undeniable undercurrent.<br/> The unspoken disagreement.<br/> They
know what I think.<br/> Apprehension pushes us apart.

Third, the excuse.<br/> Species. Hubris. History? Tradition. Intelligence... Entitlement.
DIVINITY!<br/> Authority.<br/> They know I'm not buying it.

Anxiety for them.<br/> Anxiety for me.<br/> Anxiety for everyone.

Overwhelming chaos.

A moment of silence.<br/> A moment of noise.<br/> A moment of choice.

Choice for me.<br/> Choice for them.<br/> Choice for them.

The familiar trap.<br/> Dissent or dismiss.<br/> Critique or condone.<br/> Engage or endorse.<br/>
Failure or failure.

Just disengage... it never works.<br/> Just let it go... and eat your plants.<br/> Just- Just?
Hardly.<br/> Enough is enough.

Frustration simmers.<br/> Indignation brews.<br/> Patience wears thin.<br/> The defences grow.

The absurd philosophies.<br/> The baseless ideologies.<br/> The twisted hypotheticals.<br/>
Ridiculous distractions.<br/> The tangential topics.<br/> The unrelenting rationalisations.<br/> The
blistering prejudice.

All irrelevant.

Dissonance. Dissonance. Dissonance. Endless dissonance.

Enough to fill the room.<br/> Enough to drown the conscience.<br/> Enough to end a life.

A body.<br/> A mind.<br/> A soul.<br/> A person.<br/> A life.

The plates arrive.

A steak.<br/> A snack.<br/> A meal.<br/> A taste.<br/> A moment.

Enough!

Anger. Malice. Fury.<br/> Where did these come from?<br/> Rage. Indignation. Frustration.<br/> Where
is this going?<br/> Bitterness. Disgust. Vitriol.<br/> Where do I put all this?

Overwhelming chaos.

Stop being polite.<br/> Speak the truth.<br/> State the obvious.

"THAT is a fucking PERSON!"

Underwhelming simplicity.

Shock, mouth agape.<br/> Discomfort, eyes wide.<br/> Silence... silence.

Regret. No, wait, it can't be...<br/> A hint of horror, recognition?<br/> A sliver of disgust,
acknowledgement?<br/> A gentle inwards turn!<br/> Acceptance!

Please... please... no... of course not.

A grimace of disgust, normal.<br/> A frown of contempt, always.<br/> A sneer of disapproval,
understandable.

Failure. Again.

My words disperse.<br/> Their defences distract.<br/> Our bond decays.

Snap. Closed. Distant.

No more may be said. No more will be heard. No more can be done.

The vegan crossed the line.<br/> Politeness must quell passion.<br/>

The vegan broke the contract.<br/> Tribe above the truth.<br/>

The vegan disturbed the peace.<br/> Harmony at all costs.<br/>

But most importantly...

The steak is getting cold.
