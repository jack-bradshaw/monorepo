A restaurant.<br/> A table.<br/> A friend.

A good friend.

A human.<br/> An animal.<br/> A life.

An honorable life.

A stem.<br/> A bond.<br/> A connection.

A real connection.

The familiar comfort.

The breaking glass.<br/> The cheering crowd.<br/> The shrieking child.<br/> The ringing phone.<br/>
The throbbing song.

Overwhelming chaos.

"What can I get you?"

Snap.<br/> Open.<br/> Present.

Hello Waiter.

A simple question, a complex answer.

Steak for my friend.<br/> Salad for me.<br/> Reality check for everyone.

Suddenly alone.

First, the awkwardness.<br/> The moment of silence.<br/> The broken eye contact.<br/> They know what
I know.<br/>

Politeness draws us close.

Second, the small talk.<br/> The undeniable undercurrent.<br/> The unspoken disagreement.<br/> They
know what I think.<br/>

Apprehension pushes us apart.

Third, the excuse.<br/> Species. Hubris.<br/> History? Tradition.<br/> Intelligence...
Entitlement.<br/> DIVINITY! Authority.

They know I'm not buying it.

Anxiety for them.<br/> Anxiety for me.<br/> Anxiety for everyone.

Overwhelming chaos.

A moment of silence.<br/> A moment of noise.<br/> A moment of choice.

Choice for me.<br/> Choice for them.<br/> Choice for _them_.

The familiar trap.

Dissent or dismiss.<br/> Critique or condone.<br/> Challenge or endorse.

Failure or failure.

Just disengage... it never works.<br/> Just let it go... and eat your plants.<br/> Just-

Just? Hardly!

Frustration simmers.<br/> Indignation brews.<br/> Patience wears thin.

The defenses grow.

The absurd philosophies.<br/> The baseless ideologies.<br/> The twisted hypotheticals.

Ridiculous distractions.

The tangential topics.<br/> The unrelenting rationalizations.<br/> The blistering prejudice.

All irrelevant.

Dissonance.<br/> Dissonance.<br/> Dissonance.<br/> Endless dissonance.

Enough to fill the room.<br/> Enough to drown the conscience.<br/> Enough to end a life.

A body.<br/> A mind.<br/> A soul.<br/> A person.<br/> A life.

The plates arrive.

A steak.<br/> A snack.<br/> A meal.<br/> A taste.<br/> A moment.

Enough!

Anger. Malice. Fury.<br/> Where did these come from?

Rage. Indignation. Frustration.<br/> Where is this going?

Bitterness. Disgust. Vitriol.<br/> Where do I put all this?

Overwhelming chaos.

Stop being polite.<br/> Speak the truth.<br/> State the obvious.

"THAT<br/> is a _fucking_<br/> PERSON!"

Underwhelming simplicity.

Shock, mouth agape.<br/> Discomfort, eyes wide.<br/> Silence... silence.

Regret- No, wait, it can't be...

A hint of horror, recognition?<br/> A sliver of disgust, acknowledgement?<br/> A gentle inwards
turn! Acceptance!

Please... _please_... no... no of course not.

A grimace of disgust, normal.<br/> A frown of contempt, always.<br/> A sneer of disapproval,
understandable.

Failure. Again.

My words disperse.<br/> Their defenses distract.<br/> Our bond decays.

Snap. Closed. Distant.

No more may be said.<br/> No more will be heard.<br/> No more can be done.

The vegan crossed the line: Politeness must quell passion.<br/> The vegan broke the contract: The
tribe above the truth.<br/> The vegan disturbed the peace: Harmony at all costs.

But most importantly...

The steak is getting cold.
