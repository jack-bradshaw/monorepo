One Or Many

Revision 2

I have several unpublished essays nearing completion and a few voices are emerging within me,
leading me to wonder whether publishing under various pseudonyms makes sense. I am weighing the pros
and the cons carefully, considering the possibility of backlash for controversial views, and
examining how isolated voices would be synthesised if separated; however, something draws me to
simply publish under one unified identity without further thought. You see, many years ago I came
out of the closet as a gay man, but even since then my experience of life since then has been one of
managing my true identity and wearing the masks others need me to wear. For decades I've hidden
myself to blend in at work, lied to appear normal, and maintained various personas, each with their
own perspectives and goals, all to simply navigate the complex landscape of other people's
expectations. Beyond homosexuality, I have maanged my neurodivergence by dulling my opinions and
suppressing my emotions, all so that others would find me acceptable. Frankly, I tire of it, and
dividing myself for survival has caused severe damage that has taken years to repair. I cannot
continue to sustain and repair such damage indefinitely, and it has to end.

I believe our inner voices need each other to survive, and when divided they become distorted and
incoherent. My scientific rigour and devotion to engineering are balanced by my emotional depth, and
my drive for perfection is eased by my understanding of pragmatism and distrust of ideology. When
brought together these voices are the foundation of my work, but when separated they are as useless
as dry paint. Without my care for humanity, my devotion to methodology can easily become
misanthropy, and without grounding in pragmatism, my care for others can easily become overwhelm and
despair. Genuine authenticity cannot happen if my publish under various names, for I am one cohesive
individual and my voices make me who I am.

I am Jack Bradshaw, my words are mine, and I will honour my whole self. If there is a view too
controversial to be published or a perspective too shameful to be shared, then a worthy challenge
has been found, but splitting myself into many is not the answer to the bind. I have decided not to
overthink this, not to agonise and over-analyse, and to simply allow myself to have this gift. I am
one being, and that is what others will see, without exception, without shame, and without fear.

Revision 1

I have several unpublished essays nearing completion and a few voices are emerging within me,
leading me to wonder whether publishing under various pseudonyms makes sense. I am weighing the pros
and the cons carefully, considering the possibility of backlash for controversial views and
examining how isolated voices would be synthesised if separated, but something draws me to simply
publish under one unified identity without further thought. You see, many years ago (in 2009) I came
out of the closet as a gay man, and my experience of life since has been one of reclaiming my true
identity from the masks others needed to see. I maintained various personas for decades, each with
their own perspectives and goals, all to simply navigate the complex landscape of other peoples
expectations, and frankly, I tire of it. Dividing myself and stifling my voices for survival has
caused damage no one should have to bear, and it has to end. I believe our inner voices need each
other to survive, and when divided they become distorted and incoherent. My scientific rigour and
devotion to engineering are balanced by my emotional depth, and my drive for perfection is eased by
my love of pragmatism and general distrust of ideology. When brought together these voices are the
foundation of my work, and when separated they are as useless as dry paint. Without my care for
humanity my devotion to methodology can easily become misanthropy, and without grounding in
pragmatism my care for others can easily become overwhelm and despair. To be genuine and authentic I
cannot publish under various names, for I am one cohesive individual and my voices make me who I am.
I am Jack Bradshaw, my words are mine, and I will honour my whole self. If there is a view too
controversial to be published or a perspective too shameful to be shared, then a worthy challenge
has been found, but splitting myself into many is not the answer to the bind. Instead perhaps
different publications are ideal for speaking to different audiences, but it must be one artist on
multiple stages. I have decided not to overthink this, not to agonise and over-analyse, and to
simply allow myself to have it. I am one being, and that is what others will see, without exception,
without shame, and without fear.

Capture

I have written a lot of unpublished material now and a few distinct voices have emerged, and I have
to consider whether publishing under various pseudonyms makes sense. I am weighing the pros and the
cons carefully, considering the possibility of backlash for controversial views and the desire for
reader satisfaction, yet something draws me to simply publish under one unified identity. You see,
it's been many years since I first came out of the closet as a gay man (July 11 2009) and my
experience of life since then has been one of balancing integration and disintegration. I have
maintained various personas, perspectives, and identities just to navigate the complex landscape of
sex and gender. I tire of it, and have found so much joy in being one unified whole. I contain many
voices yes, but we are one. I am one. Life is too short to manage other peoples expectations and
split myself into multiple people just to avoid offence or gain readership, so no, I will not
publish under various names. I am Jack Bradshaw, and my words are mine. If there is a view too
controversial to be published or a perspective too shameful to be shared, then a worthy challenge
has been found but splitting myself is not the answer. I have decided not to overthink this, not to
agonise and analyse, and simply do what feels right. I will publish as one being.
