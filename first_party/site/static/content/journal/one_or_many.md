I have dozens of unpublished essays nearing completion and a few voices are emerging within me,
leading me to wonder whether publishing under various pseudonyms makes sense. I am weighing the pros
and the cons carefully, considering the possibility of backlash for controversial views, and
examining how isolated voices would be synthesized if separated; however, something draws me to
simply publish under one unified identity without further thought.

You see, many years ago I came out of the closet as a gay man, but despite the openness, my
experience of life since has been one of managing my true identity and wearing the masks others want
me to wear. For decades I've hidden myself to blend in at work, lied to appear normal, and
maintained various personas, each with their own perspectives and goals, all to simply navigate the
complex landscape of other people's expectations. Beyond homosexuality, I have managed my
neurodivergence by dulling my opinions and suppressing my emotions, all so that others would find me
palatable. Frankly, I tire of it, and dividing myself for survival has caused severe damage that has
taken years to repair. I cannot continue to sustain this system indefinitely, and it has to end.

I believe our inner voices need each other to survive, and when divided they become distorted and
incoherent. My scientific rigor and devotion to engineering are balanced by my care for others, and
my drive for perfection is eased by my pragmatism and distrust of ideology. When brought together,
these voices are the foundation of my work, but when separated, they are as useless as dry clay.
Methodology without compassion can easily become misanthropy, perfection without pragmatism can
easily become overwhelm and despair. Genuine authenticity and meaningful work cannot happen if I
split myself apart and publish under various names, for I am one cohesive individual, and my voices
make me who I am.

I am Jack Bradshaw, my words are mine, and I must honor my whole self. If there is a view too
controversial to be shared or a topic too inappropriate to be discussed, then a worthy challenge has
been found, but splitting myself into many is not the answer to the bind. Different publications
could help reach different audiences, but it must be one artist on multiple stages, not one
pretending to be many. I have decided not to overthink this, not to agonize and over-analyze, and to
simply allow myself to have this gift. I am one being, and that is what others will see, without
exception, without shame, and without fear.
