The act of writing, drafting, editing, revising, and finally publishing, is an act of self
transformation. It begins with unstructured thought, the raw material of the soul, and ends when
that which has meaning to the author has been made meaningful to others. Along the way, disorder is
challenged, balance emerges between opposites, and the author's own mind is enriched. Perspective
broadens and skills sharpen, until the author's own voice has been revealed as no more than a
character in a story. After all is said and done, a new person emerges, and their work stands as the
testament not to who they are now, but to who they shed to be here. We don't write for other people,
we write to find ourselves, and when others find value in our words, that simply means we helped
they along the way.

It's this metamorphosis which differentiates human writers from today's artificial intelligence, and
when a person generates text without undergoing the change, they deny themselves the opportunity to
grow. Anything they produce will always be limited by the technology they have used, and they will
never learn to grow beyond their inherent limitations. In some ways, we could look at artificial
intelligence the same way we look at purchasing an item from a store: Buying something and being
able to demand more is not a skill, nor does it nurture the soul, it simply defers the work to
someone else. Through buying furniture you gain a beautiful home, and others may praise your decor,
but did you truly produce anything other than an arrangement? Did you learn to build a chair, or
create a painting? Did you grow new skills and discover yourself, or did you simply take other
people's work and place it on a wall? This is not to say everyone must be a master of everything,
nor should it be taken as a dismissal of the usefulness of an assistant, but to choose the life of a
renaissance man (or more modernly, renaissance person) is the richest of dreams, and what is the
point of life if not growth?

I love to grow and develop new skills, especially when that means finding my limitations and
overcoming them. It's the most enjoyable part of life, and it's that joy which artificial
intelligence will never replicate, because that joy comes from deep within and is inherent to who we
are. We must find that joy to live, but offloading it to an artificial intelligence is not a viable
path. In summary, writing is a deeply human act which nurtures the soul, and when we use artificial
intelligence to bypass the difficulty parts, we do a great disservice to ourselves.
