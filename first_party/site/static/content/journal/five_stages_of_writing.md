If you write while searching for truth, you will write nonsense and fools will love you.

If you write while you hold the truth, you will write nonsense and academics will love you.

If you write while the truth is slipping away, you will write nonsense and the mystics will love
you.

If you write when you have learned to let the truth go, you will write nonsense and the poets will
love you.

If you write when you have forgotten about the truth entirely, you will write honestly and no one
will love you.
