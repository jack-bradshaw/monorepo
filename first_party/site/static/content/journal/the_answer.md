The universe has many mysteries.

The thinking mind searches for answers. It grasps at the unknown as a child would toward its
parents. To know and to understand are its purpose, yet it creates for itself an endless maze with
no hope of escape. Further and further it spirals down the rabbit hole of its own creation, never
able to see beyond the limits of its own making. A quiet companion sits beside it, patient and
silent, until its moment comes to pass. Beating tirelessly and asking for nothing in return, the
heart knows what the mind cannot see. It feels the deep truths, it speaks only when it knows it will
be heard, and it uses a language words can never capture. I can never write its message perfectly,
but if you are reading this, then perhaps part of you can sense the answer. It lives within you,
just as it lives within me, patiently waiting for the mind to be still.

Let go of thought and the answers will become clear. Let go of desire and the way will show itself.
Let go of yourself and you will become whole. Let go of truth and you will see through the lies. If
you absolutely must have answers, then start with an empty page. Everything you need is already
there.
