The pragmatist in me views altruism as a noble, but unfortunately difficult pursuit, and wonders how
possible it is. The cynic in me believes it to be an expression of my genome, an unconscious drive
to do what is best for the propagation of my species and, by extension, life itself. The altruist in
me sees these two and smiles with gentle understanding.

Cynicism. Pragmatism. Altruism. Three pillars of humanity. Three mortal enemies. Three bound
together for all time.

Of course, altruism must come out on top, and it always does in the end, because living in a world
the morality, ethics, and whatever we personally believe to be right, must be obtainable. Should we
find ourselves in a world where nature itself prevents their attainment, we face a binary choice.
Self destruction, by means of literal death or modifying our selves to an unrecognisable degree, or
transcendence above nature.

I choose the latter. Not through spirituality or prayer, but through the rigorous and methodical
application of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We must engineer a better
world because the one we emerged from is not our friend. It exerts a constant pressure on the
altruist and feeds the cynic. As the pragmatist watches on, and sees this system play out, they do
only one thing.

Adapt.

We will change the world. We will change ourselves. We will change everything. We will remake the
world not in our image, but in the image of a pragmatist choosing altruism over cynicism. It’s the
only path forward.

One question remains in my mind. If we have such power, and engineering history has demonstrated we
do, why do we limit ourselves? I have often wondered what is the right path, not momentarily or
incidentally, but in general. Beyond the abstract systems of consequentialism and deontology, beyond
the meta-analysis of Kohlberg and others, and beyond the pseudo spiritual guidance of mysticism,
what is right?

I don’t know if a final answer can exist, but today I considered a new option.

The altruist reaches a point where their own actions reach a pragmatic optimum and all that remains
is the cynicism of others. If they truly are an altruist, then all they can seek is altruism for
others. I believe the question is no longer what should I do, but what can I do to help others
answer the question for themselves. Maybe together we can find a better answer that a single mind
cannot.
