The pragmatist in me views altruism as a noble, but unfortunately difficult pursuit, and wonders how
feasible it really is. The cynic in me believes altruism to be an expression of my genome, an
unconscious drive to do what is best for the propagation of my species, and by extension, life
itself. The altruist in me sees these two, and smiles with gentle understanding.

Cynicism. Pragmatism. Altruism.

Three pillars of humanity. Three mortal enemies. Three bound together for all time.

I believe that altruism will come out on top, eventually, because living in a universe where
altruism is not possible is untenable. Should we ever find ourselves in a world where nature itself
fundamentally prevents altruism, we face a binary choice: Self-destruction, by means of literal
death (or self-modification to an unrecognisable degree), or transcendence above nature, with the
goal of changing the fundamental structure of reality.

I choose the latter, not through spirituality or prayer, but through the rigorous and methodical
application of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I must engineer a better world,
because the one I emerged into is not kind, and it destroys everything in due time. It exerts a
constant pressure against the altruist to concede defeat, it begs the pragmatist to betray the
altruist, and it feeds the cynic endlessly.

As the pragmatist watches on, and sees this system play out, they can do only one thing.

Adapt.

We will change the world. We will change ourselves. We will change everything. We will not accept
the situation as is; instead, we will remake reality, not in our image, but in the image of a
pragmatist choosing altruism over cynicism.

One question remains in my mind. If we do have such power, and engineering history suggests perhaps
we do, what limits us? I have often wondered what is the path of altruism, not momentarily or
incidentally, but in general. I wonder, beyond the abstract moral systems of consequentialism and
deontology, beyond the ethical meta-analysis of Kohlberg, and beyond the spiritual warmth of
mysticism, what actually limits us? What is the ultimate restricting factor for altruism?

I don’t have an answer yet, but today I considered a new perspective:

The motivated altruist reaches a point where their own actions reach a pragmatic optimum and all
that limits them is the cynicism of others. In essence, the altruist in a world of cynics can only
go so far. In recognising this, if they truly are the altruist, then all they can seek at that point
is altruism for others. I believe the question is no longer what should one individual do, but what
can we all do to help others answer the question for themselves. Maybe together we can find a better
answer than a single mind can.

All this to say, in a world of cynics, the altruist faces an uphill battle, but in a world where
society fosters altruism and rewards it, where altruism is not a noble unattainable deed, but a
standard norm, the altruist can go far. Creating that world is the task of the pragmatist, the dream
of the altruist, and the hidden hope of the cynic.

The only remaining question, is how.
