Dear Reader,

My drafts have filled my notebook and my desire to publish has reached a boiling point, but none
meet my expectations for quality. Each has substance, but they all need refinement and editorial
work. Despite my best intentions, every attempt at revision creates conflict between my authentic
voice and my polished tone, and it seems impossible to make changes without subtracting from the
passion that drives me. My frustration is building, and as my patience wears thin a part of me
demands a path forward. Perhaps the question to consider is: what spurs me to refine my work in the
first place?

Considering this points towards an answer. While it’s true that my original work holds my rawest
truth, my objective is more than speaking without filtration. My goal is to connect with others,
share meaningful experiences, and find ideas worthy of discussion. I hope to discover novel ways of
being, open doors we aren’t aware of yet, and understand the core of the human condition. This path
is difficult for both reader and writer, so polish before publication is mutually beneficial. I
believe an audience is something to be cherished, and there is a certain respect that must be paid.
Readers deserve a carefully crafted piece with refinement and finesse, and placing the burden of
editorial on you to preserve my original voice would be distasteful in my view. It amounts to little
more than personal vanity at the cost of the many. It’s a privilege to have your time, and I owe you
something refined.

Contemplation of this position yields a simple and obvious truth: I must find a way to refine my
work without diluting my message or altering my voice. I cannot accept the dichotomy between quality
and authenticity, and I shall seek ways to have both. That is to say, the tradeoff need not be
intractable. I suspect this skill is a necessary step on the path to success, and balance must be
possible. This ambition leads to a practical solution with three parts: a promise, a technique, and
a decision. Let’s take them in order.

First. My promise to you, dear reader, is as follows: I hope to provide you with something
effortless to follow and enjoyable to read. I wish to bear fruit both sweet and sour, but never
toxic, tasteless, or unripe. I seek to touch your heart and fill your mind, yet be gentle and tender
to your eyes and ears. I believe creatures such as us thrive in humility and curiosity, but suffer
in the noise of miscommunication and disparagement, meaning the onus is on me to do the heavy
lifting before revealing my work. That is my intention, and I wish to be an honourable man.

Second. My technique, which still needs polish, stems from a willingness to find areas of growth
instead of merely searching for errors. There exists a fine line between critique and criticism, and
choosing to focus on making improvements before fixing errors will help me greatly. When my mind
goes to worries and mistake hunting, it’s best to step away and try again later. My conscious
intention must be patience and authenticity, never premature publication or perfection. Delay will
be my tool of choice, and inaction will be my virtue. I believe this approach will balance my voice
with the quality all readers deserve, and although it’s an arduous task, one which may take a
lifetime to master, such is the case for many worthwhile pursuits.

Third. My decision concerns my faith in our bond. As reader and writer, we are bound together by
monologue with little opportunity for discussion or clarification, particularly if you survive me.
This presents many challenges for communication; however, it also creates an opportunity to deepen
our shared humanity. I have decided to put faith in my ability to express myself, your capacity to
comprehend my meaning, and our common willingness to relate across great distances. I find liberty
in proceeding under the assumption that perfection is unnecessary for effective communication, and
it creates more room for both of us: a space for me to express my creativity and a place for you to
explore new perspectives. I will not allow perfection to become my jailer, and I will not deny you
the opportunity to form your own opinion.

I have more to say, but that’s enough for now. I will stand by my promise, continue to refine my
technique, and commit to my decision. My work will flourish in due time, and when that happens, we
can continue our conversation. Until then, take care.

Warmly,<br/> Jack Bradshaw.
