I once saw otters at the Sacramento Zoo. My spouse surprised me on our anniversary because he knows
they’re my favorite animals. We drove three hours from our home, both excited, but were horrified
when we arrived to discover his conditions. An American River otter was confined in a tiny
plexiglass enclosure with barely enough space to breathe, no privacy, and nothing to entertain him,
save for a pool the size of a bathtub. The conditions of his confinement were saddening, but that
isn't what stands out in memory: It was his behavior.

I watched for an hour as he performed the same motion endlessly: Drive into the pool, swim to the
other side, jump out of the pool, run to the other side, repeat. He barely stopped to rest, and I
want to believe he was enjoying himself, but there’s a simpler answer: He couldn't stop. I suspect
this poor animal had become so trapped in a loop without an exit he could not find his way out. Do
you think he's still running in circles?

In reflection it dawned on me, there's another animal on this planet that runs in circles and
repeats itself: Us. Live, work, sleep, work, live, work, sleep, work. Buy, buy, buy. Eat. Eat. Eat.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. An infinite list of tasks keeps us busy until the day we die, with thought after
thought running through our minds in endless succession. I wonder why the otter does not simply stop
and refuse to dance for his onlookers, but the same could be said of us: Why don’t we humans ever
just stop and refuse to continue our own loops? Why don't we just choose to be content as we are?
What force pushes us forward without purpose or end?

Are we in a zoo, perhaps? I can see no captors or onlookers, but a zoo for us would not be one of
plexiglass and bathtubs. Our otter friend is contained by walls, but they are not his only prison.
He follows the script for the same reason we do: he believes it has purpose, and he is so engrossed
in his activity that stopping has slipped from his mind entirely. Our cage is one of the mind, not
the world: A cage of our own conviction. If we are to avoid the same fate as our otter friend, we
must examine the source of our own beliefs and find an exit from the endless hamster wheel of
thinking.

I lay awake in bed right now, apparently doing nothing, but we are rarely doing nothing. Our minds
continue to tick when our bodies are still and this idea is festering. If we are to escape the fate
of the otter, it’s not enough to halt physically. The mind must also become still, deeply, and
completely, beyond sleep and meditation. The mind must choose to halt its own endless march of doing
to be free. It's no easy task, but fortunately, the tools of cessation are not novel and have been
known for millennia.

We all have within us the same capacity for equanimity and detachment practiced by the Buddha under
the Bodhi tree, and we all have the grace of Wu Wei practiced by the ancient Taoists. All such
ancient practices are simply different encodings of the same underlying idea, and it doesn’t require
spiritual enlightenment or mystical belief to become still. It’s innate to our beings. It comes when
we look inside ourselves without judgment, see the patterns we take for granted, and let them come
to a gradual halt. Our thoughts require our consent and participation to continue, and we can choose
to step out of the loop at any time. What we find in stillness is always personal and unique to
everyone, but perhaps my journey might help you with yours.

I looked inside and found myself sitting next to a pond. Waves moved across the surface, but as I
looked closely, I realized my own hands were creating the disturbance. The cause-effect relationship
was deeply obscured, but it was the very grasping for stillness that was creating the noise and
disrupting the reflection. Allowing my mind to settle by leaving the unanswered questions alone and
letting the unresolved thought go was the key to accurate self reflection, but it was no easy task,
and I now understand why. What I saw in the reflection was deeply frightening, and the obstructing
thoughts were keeping me safe. Some might call them defense mechanisms.

I saw myself as two beings: one violent and vengeful, ready to set the world on fire, and one
peaceful and benevolent, endlessly contemplating and questioning: A wild animal with vicious claws
occupying the same space as a being of pure light. They were not separate, but not whole either,
more akin to conjoined twins fused far below the surface, endlessly intersecting and moving through
each other. At first, I wondered which was me and which was the parasite, but they are both me. At
some point my mind must have forked, like a river going two ways, and I diverged. All the thoughts,
all the doing, and all the endless chasing of money and success were just a distraction from this
painful truth.

As I stared into my own divergent reflection, I became aware of a lie: I am not who I think I am. I
am a captive because I am a captor. I hold the lock and I hold the key. I am the voice that was
trained to be quiet, and I am the speaker who believes there is nothing worth saying. I built myself
this prison because I thought it was the only way to survive, and I lied to myself to make it real.
It hurts to be divergent though, and there was only one path forward: Recoherence.

The exact method is a story for another day, for it was not trivial, but bringing the two halves
back together began by finding the point of divergence. I searched through the pain by keeping my
mind still and letting it come to me, and eventually discovered the core of this condition: Inner
conflict on a fundamental level. Divergence is what happens when a mind has conflicting beliefs
right to its core. The topic of the disagreement, it turns out, was quite simple: Safety. A
universal human need that is not universally available.

Is the world peaceful or is it dangerous? That question was the source of my divergence, and unable
to find an answer, my mind went in both directions. I developed two distinct perspectives, not to
the degree of dissociative identity disorder, but enough to create significant stress on the
surface. One identity kept me safe from danger through fear and suspicion, and the other reached out
for connection with care and curiosity. In time, the dissonance became too great and led to the
questions that brought us here, but until then, the true version of me was trapped to run in circles
like our otter friend.

I have since come to realize the answer to the disagreement is, unsatisfyingly, both. The world is
as dangerous as it is peaceful. It varies from place to place and time to time. Knowing when to be
guarded and when to be at ease is not simple, but the path to recoherence begins with the acceptance
that life is rarely so neat and tidy. I still feel both halves within me, but no longer are they
belligerent enemies, instead they have learned to act as one.

All this to say: We run in loops because the alternative, being still, forces us to confront
questions and truths we would rather avoid. We all have different structures and systems deep within
us, so my question to you is: Who are you talking to in your own mind? Follow that question far
enough and you might find a way to escape your own cycles.
