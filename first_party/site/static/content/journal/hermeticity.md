Hermeticity is not anarchy, it is not authoritarianism, and it is not in between. The hermeticist
values liberty but is not libertarian, recognizes the importance of society but is not socialist,
and deeply values community but is not communist. Hermeticity exists at neither extreme of any
political spectrum, nor does it exist between them: It is beyond them entirely.

Where others seek to classify, the hermeticist seeks to mitigate. Where the anarchist sees a world
of order and seeks to break the chains that bind society, the hermeticist views a misguided heart.
Where the authoritarian sees a world of resources and seeks to conquer others, they see a game that
cannot be won. The hermeticist does not struggle and they have stopped playing, because the world is
too complicated for overhaul or conformity, and there is precious little time for such affairs.
Neither top-down controls nor bottom-up movements can create the paradise we all yearn for, and
every attempt to shift the balance of power only exacerbates the conflict, creates the conditions
for bloodshed, and prolongs the suffering. Every system eventually breaks down, and when it does the
opportunity for change presents itself, but we are rarely so lucky as to be there when it does. The
hermeticist does not pretend otherwise.

The hermeticist accepts reality completely, finds a way to insulate themselves and their loved ones
from the caustic effects of the world, and carries on. They see an oncoming storm, release any
delusion of control, and build a shelter that will stand the test of time. They see a flood coming
and move out of the way, but accept the inevitability of their end, knowing that one day the waters
rise above all defenses no matter how careful the preparation. In the time remaining, they do what
they can to help others, but accept the limits of virtue, and remain pragmatic. They work within the
system, carving out nooks and crannies wherever possible, gradually laying the seeds of change while
dreaming of a world where the games we play don't matter. They do this knowing they will not see it
come to pass in their lifetime.

If you have grown weary of the system, of the endless conflict and the dead children, then find the
rot, understand it, and learn to exist despite it. Ignore the bait, silence the revolutionary, and
let polarized conversation go. Greet everyone as both a friend to be loved and a carrier for a
system to be mitigated. Take opportunities to nudge reality in the direction of altruism, but never
make the mistake of believing the entire world can be changed today. Desire is the beginning of
delusion, and only corruption and weariness can follow. Seek neither control over others nor freedom
from control, instead, seek liberty within your own mind, for that is the only place where true
freedom can exist.
