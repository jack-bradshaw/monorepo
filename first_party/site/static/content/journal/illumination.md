Illumination reveals many truths, but casts equally as many shadows, and in its presence we find
others' true intentions. Those of malice see darkness and find someone to blame, while those of pure
heart see the brightness and are blinded by its beauty. Those of balance see the edges that separate
the source from the shadows, and those with true wisdom close their eyes and withdraw. What do you
see?
