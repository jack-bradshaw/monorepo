Hi there! I'm Jack Bradshaw.

Welcome to my website. It serves as a living archive of my work, thoughts, and creative
explorations.

Feel free to explore my [gallery](/gallery/highlights) for my visual art, my
[journal](/journal/highlights) for my written documents, and my [repository](/repository/highlights)
for my open source software. You can also find my social media presence and work history on my
[about](/about) page.

I hope you enjoy exploring!
