The canonical source of truth for the appearance of the site. These are used by
[ContentAppearanceTest](first_party/site/tests/ContentAppearanceTest.kt) and
[MenuTest](first_party/site/tests/MenuTest.kt) for screendiff testing.

## Source

The images in this package were generated by the CI infrastructure (i.e. GitHub Actions); therefore,
tests may fail on systems (e.g. local developer workstations) due to subtle rendering issues. Since
the CI infrastructure is the ultimate gatekeeper to main and production, failures on other systems
are acceptable, and they do not block submission to main.
