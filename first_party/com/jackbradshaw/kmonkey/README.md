# KMonkey

Kotlin tools for the JMonkey engine.

## Getting Access

There are three ways to include this library in your project:

1. Use the pre-built package.
2. Build the package from source.
3. Reference the source directly.

### Pre-built Package

To use the pre-built package, add `com.jackbradshaw:kmonkey:1.0.0` to your project's Maven dependencies. Older
versions are available in the [Maven Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.jackbradshaw/kmonkey).

### Building From Source

To build the package from source:

1. [Install Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jack-bradshaw/monorepo`
3. Start the build: `bazel build //first_party/com/jackbradshaw/kmonkey:binary.deploy`

This will produce a jar in the `monorepo/bazel-out/first_party/com/jackbradshaw/kmonkey` directory. Copy this Jar into your
project as needed.

### Referencing Directly

To reference the package directly in another Bazel workspace:

1. Install this repository in your WORKSPACE.
2. Reference the library target in your deps.

For example:

```
# In your WORKSPACE file
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")
git_repository(
    name = "com_jackbradshaw",
    branch = "main",
    remote = "https://github.com/jack-bradshaw/monorepo",
)

# In your BUILD file
kt_jvm_library(
    name = "hello_world",
    srcs = "HelloWorld.kt",
    deps = [
        "@com_jackbradshaw//:first_party/com/jackbradshaw/kmonkey",
    ]
)
```

## Tutorial

KMonkey provides two utilities for using coroutines with JMonkey:

- A rendering dispatcher that runs coroutines on the main thread.
- A physics dispatcher that runs coroutines on the physics thread.

For example, the following code will add an item to the scene graph and move it each second:

```
import com.jackbradshaw.kmonkey.coroutines.renderingDispatcher

class MyApplication : SimpleApplication {

  /* Snip: All the usual setup stuff. */

  private val worldItem by lazy { SomeWorldItem() }

  init {
    renderingDispatcher().launch {
      rootNode.attachChild(worldItem)
      var index = 0
      while(true) {
        index += 1
        delay(1000L) // 1 second
        worldItem.setLocalTranslation(Vecor3f(index, 0, 0))
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Similarly, the following code will add an item to the physics space and apply a force each second:

```
import com.jackbradshaw.kmonkey.coroutines.physicsDispatcher

class MyApplication : SimpleApplication {

  /* Snip: All the usual setup stuff. */

  private val physicsItem by lazy { SomePhysicsItem() }

  init {
    val bullet = BulletAppState().apply { stateManager.attach(it) }
    val physicsSpace = bullet.getPhysicsSpace()
    physicsSpace.physicsDispatcher().launch {
      physicsSpace.add(physicsItem)
      while(true) {
        delay(1000L) // 1 second
        physicsItem.applyCentralForce(Vector3f(1, 0, 0))
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You don't actually need to be in the SimpleApplication to use the dispatchers. For example:

```
class SomeRandomClass(
  private val application: SimpleApplication,
  private val physicsSpace: PhysicsSpace
) {
  init {
    application.renderingDispatcher().launch { /* rendering code */ }
    physicsSpace.physicsDispatcer().launch { /* physics code */ }
  }
}

```

Voil√†! You can now use coroutines with JMonkey without the risk of wrong-thread exceptions.
