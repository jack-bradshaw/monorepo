Borderline

Revision 2

Not enough. Never enough.

Die son die.
FAKER!
Rot in Hell, Fag!

Her echoes ring. Endless. Indelible.

Hate.
Lies.
Rage.

An image owned by her.

Mother. Monster. Monster. Mother.
Monster.
Mother?

Unbearable weight.
Given to a child.
By an adult.
By a child.
To an adult.
To a child.
Never truly an adult.
Never truly a child.

I gave you so much.
I gave you nothing.
I gave you everything.
I gave you.
I, GAVE!

Her image hangs in my soul.
Not my image. My image regardless.
Right mirror. Wrong image.
Wrong in every way.
The perfect mirror image.

An heirloom no one wanted.

We don’t speak anymore.
Who does she give it to now?
Who drinks the poison for her?

Her? No. She can't. She never could.

I do, despite years apart.
I do, despite oceans between.
I do, despite all common sense.

For between our pain there is no border line.
