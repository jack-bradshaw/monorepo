Disapproval

Final Revision


Create the silence. Listen. Do you hear them?

...

Voices murmur in the background.
Quiet yet deafening.
Chaos hiding a steady beat.

Tap. Tap. Tap.  

A hammer strikes the base of the skull from within.  
Gentle. Violent. Silent. Painful.
Sharp. Solid. Tender. Broken.

Unrelenting. 

Numb. All numb.
Painless but lifeless.
Living but not alive.
No way to live. No way to die.
No need to live. No need to die.

No needs, but needs regardless.

I can't live here.
Heat it up. Melt the ice.
I don't live here.
Gasp. Splutter. Inhale.
I won't live here.
Take the breath denied for decades.

Not with lungs.

Choke back the tears. They come anyway.  
Let them flow. Feel the release.
Enjoy a moment. Enjoy the free-

Tap. Tap. Snap.

A room? The wrong room.
A prison? A home? Not real.
Very real. Always real. 
Always the wrong room.
A prison? A home?
A prisoner’s home.

Feel the dust.

Decades passed here. Never past though.
Still here. Still there. Still alive...  
Not alive. Waiting. Still. Completely still.

Nothing to do but wait.

The clock holds the door shut. Wait for it to open.  
You can't leave. You can never leave.

The clock holds the door shut. Wait for it to open.  
The window remains sealed. The view changes. The others smile. 

The clock holds the door shut. Wait for it to open.  
The body ages. Nothing changes.  

The clock does not stop. The clock can never stop.
The door opens.  
Open now. Go. Leave.

...

No.
