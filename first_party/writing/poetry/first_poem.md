There is no freedom and there is no control.
There is no self and there are no others.
There are no prisons and there are no homes.

Such arbitrary distinctions are distractions.
Artefacts of a mind grasping for answers.

We search for structure and so we find barriers.
We search for answers and so we find questions.
We search for meaning and so we find nonsense.

In grasping we find nothing beyond our understanding.

From that nothingness arises reality.
A reality we cannot comprehend.
From that confusion arises chaos.

Chaos within chaos.
Order beyond sense.
A unending rhythm.

The mind holds the lock.
Always prying it open.

The heart holds the key.
Waiting to be acknowledged.

The space between them holds the pain.
Waiting for release.

All three exactly where they need to be.

Let go of the need for understanding.
The heart will open.
Let go of the need to hear
The heart will sing.
That song is all we really need.

Can you hear it?
