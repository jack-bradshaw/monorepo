Final

A restaurant. A table. A friend.
A good friend.

A human. An animal. A life.
An honourable life.

A stem. A bond. A connection.
A real connection.

The familiar comfort.

The breaking glass.
The cheering crowd.
The shrieking child.
The ringing phone.
The throbbing song.

Overwhelming chaos.

"What can I get you?"
Snap. Open. Present.
Hello Waiter.

A simple question, a complex answer.

Steak for them.
Salad for me.
Reality check for everyone.

Suddenly alone.

First, the awkwardness.
The moment of silence.
The broken eye contact.
They know what I know.

Politeness draws us close.

Second, the small talk.
The undeniable undercurrent.
The unspoken disagreement.
They know what I think.

Apprehension pushes us apart.

Third, the excuse. 
Species. Hubris.
History? Tradition.
Intelligence... Entitlement. 
DIVINITY! Authority.
They know I'm not buying it. 

Anxiety for them.
Anxiety for me.
Anxiety for everyone.

Overwhelming chaos.

A moment of silence.
A moment of noise.
A moment of choice.

Choice for me.
Choice for them.
Choice for them.

The familiar trap.

Dissent or dismiss.
Critique or condone.
Engage or endorse.

Failure or failure.

Just disengage... it never works.
Just let it go... and eat your plants.
Just-

Just? Hardly. Enough is enough.

Frustration simmers.
Indignation brews.
Patience wears thin.

The defences grow.

The absurd philosophies.
The baseless ideologies.
The twisted hypotheticals.
Ridiculous distractions.

The tangential topics.
The unrelenting rationalisations.
The blistering prejudice.
All irrelevant.

Dissonance.
Dissonance.
Dissonance.
Endless dissonance.

Enough to fill the room.
Enough to drown the conscience.
Enough to end a life.

A body.
A mind.
A soul.
A person.
A life.

The plates arrive.

A steak.
A snack.
A meal.
A taste.
A moment.

Enough!

Anger. Malice. Fury.
Where did these come from?
Rage. Indignation. Frustration.
Where is this going?
Bitterness. Disgust. Vitriol.
Where do I put all this?

Overwhelming chaos.

Stop being polite.
Speak the truth.
State the obvious.

"THAT
is a fucking
PERSON!"

Underwhelming simplicity.

Shock, mouth agape.
Discomfort, eyes wide.
Silence... silence.

Regret. No, wait, it can't be...

A hint of horror, recognition?
A sliver of disgust, acknowledgement?
A gentle inwards turn! Acceptance!

Please... please... no... of course not.

A grimace of disgust, normal.
A frown of contempt, always.
A sneer of disapproval, understandable.

Failure. Again.

My words disperse.
Their defences distract.
Our bond decays.

Snap. Closed. Distant.

No more may be said.
No more will be heard.
No more can be done.

The vegan crossed the line, politeness must quell passion.
The vegan broke the contract, tribe above the truth.
The vegan disturbed the peace, harmony at all costs.

But most importantly...

The steak is getting cold.

Revision

A restaurant. A table. A friend.

A human. An animal. A life.

A cell. A stem. A connection.



A bond.



A glass breaks.

A crowd cheers.

A waiter appears.



Overwhelming chaos.



What can I get you?

A simple question.

A complex answer.



Tofu please.

Steak thanks.

A divergence.



Here we go.



First the awkwardness.

The moment of silence.

The broken eye contact.

They know what I know.



Politeness draws us back.



Second the irrelevant conversation.

The undeniable undercurrent.

The unspoken conflict.

They know what I think.



Awkwardness pushes us apart.



Third the excuse.

“Animals, probably. Species.

“Intelligence” sometimes. Values.

“God” occasionally. Divinity.

They know I’m not buying it.



A moment of silence.

A moment of noise.

A choice to consider.



A choice between two wars.



Engage or disengage. Fairness or avoidance.

Confront or condone. Justice or complacency.

Challenge or conform. Disruption or politeness.



A moral imperative, yet conflict rarely ends well.



With good intentions, the result is discomfort.

With sound strategy, the move is ignorance.

With genuine empathy, the outcome is failure.



Today though, something is different. So much noise.



Frustration is higher.

Tolerance is lower.

Indignation is rising.



Overwhelming chaos.



They’re eating a person.

Obvious to me.

Unfathomable to them.

A simple observation, stated as fact.



The sparring begins.



The irrelevant topics.

The baseless philosophy.

The absurd justifications.



Overwhelming chaos.



The nonsensical delusions.

The unrelenting rationalisations.

The blistering apathy.



Below it all?



Dissonance. Endless dissonance.

Enough to fill libraries.

Enough to drown the conscience.

Enough to deny one simple fact.



They’re eating a name.

They’re eating a face.

They’re eating a life.

They’re eating a person.



Horrific. Commonplace. Horrific.



I was told the truth shall set you free.

But who is in the cage?

And who is holding the key?



Is the captor a captive?



Sitting across from me are two minds.

One kind, one blind.

One open, one closed.

One curious, one certain.

Who is in control?



Both, and neither.

An apathetic heart and a misguided mind.

A heart and mind misaligned.

With wisdom strained between them.



Overwhelming chaos.



We continue.

A fight. A battle. A slog.

A war.



Persist.



Finally, a glimmer of hope.

Facts supplant falsehood.

Truth overcomes denial.

Compassion reveals compassion.



Chaos becomes simplicity.



The result?

A moment of recognition.

A glimpse at reality.

A look of horror.

Veganism.



Victory? No. Not today.



A seed has been planted, it needs time to grow.

A perspective has been sown, it needs space to take.

A mind has been changed, it needs grace to think.



Whether it open again is anyone’s guess.



As for me?

It’s time to rest.

I am tired.

Capture

A restaurant. A table. A friend.

Normal. Kind. Blind.

Human.



A waiter appears as the crowd cheers.



What can I get you?

A simple question.

A complex answer.



Tofu please.

Steak thanks.

Here we go.



First the awkwardness.

The moment of silence.

The broken eye contact.



Politeness draws us back.



Second the irrelevant conversation.

The undeniable undercurrent.

The unspoken conflict.



Awkwardness lingers.



Third the excuse.

“Animals” probably.

“Intelligence” sometimes.

“Nature” occasionally.



What next? A choice. A choice for me.



Engage or disengage.

Confront or condone.

Challenge or conform.



It rarely ends well.



No matter my intentions, the result is discomfort.

No matter my strategy, the move is ignorance.

No matter my effort, the outcome is failure.



Today, something is different.



Frustration is higher.

Tolerance is lower.

Indignation is rising.



I am not letting them get away with it. Not this time.



They’re eating a person.

Obvious to me.

Unfathomable to them.

A simple observation, stated as fact.



The sparring begins.



The irrelevant topics.

The meaningless philosophy.

The absurd justifications.



The nonsensical delusions.

The unrelenting detachment.

The blistering incoherence.



Below it all?



Endless dissonance.

Enough to fill libraries.

All to deny one simple fact.



They’re eating a person.



The truth shall set you free.

Or so they say.

But who?



Sitting across from me are two minds.

One kind, one blind.

One open, one closed.

One curious, one certain.

Who am I actually speaking to?



Both, and neither.

The mind between them.

The untapped wisdom of the heart and mind combined.



We continue.

A fight. A battle. A slog.

Finally, a glimmer of hope.



Facts supplant falsehood

Redirection destroys distraction.

Compassion reveals compassion.



The result?



A moment of recognition.

A look of horror.

A glimpse of reality.



Victory? No. Not today.



A seed has been planted.

A fact has been sown.

A mind has been opened.



Whether is closes is a matter of time.



As for me?

It’s time to rest.

I am tired.
