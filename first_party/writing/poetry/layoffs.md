Status: Though Dump

Today Amazon laid off employees in various divisions, mostly corporate, with the intention of
replacing them with artificial intelligence. I can understand why they might do this, after all they
are definitively an organisation designed to produce profit for shareholders, and replacing
expensive human labour with cheap automation is a sensible way to reduce costs, but I doubt the
corporate justification is any consolation for the employees and their families. Those are real
people with real needs, and I have to wonder what happens next.

This has an implication for 2026. We approach a new year, but we don't approach it unified and
equal. Some enter the new year with secure and stable income, and -

this isnt working.

the rich eat the poor

layoffs occur. fear spreads through the wires and the waves. some go home one last time.

tension. uncertainty. unease.
shame. humiliation. distress.

the villain is found. the defences fall apart. the poor eat the rich-


less poetic. no better poetry.


layoffs have occurred. the result is fear, uncertainty, and corporate profits in the short term. 

im losing the picture now. i cant find it anymore. where did it go?

watch america from above. watch the people move. watch how they drive their cars back and forth.

from work to home. from home to work. again and again and again.

today something is different.
thirty thousand things are different.
thirty thousand people are different.

the layoffs have come again.

connected by wires and waves the fear spreads through the people.
who is next? this is inhumane. we are people!
their voices go unheard.

time moves on as it always does.
the endless ticking of the clock.
never stopping. never faltering. never waiting.

onwards. upwards.
onwards. downwards.
a fork in the heart of humanity.

where some perish others benefit.

the rich fear being eaten by the poor.
the rich love being fed by the poor.
the rich love to feed on the poor.

this time is different.
this time its corporate.
the butcher has become the meat.

employee terminated. next.
employee terminated. next.
empl- me? oh. oh...

for so many years, the many protect the few
for so many dollars, the many obey the few
for so many lives, the many serve the few

the fear they use, their weapon of choice, is all they truly have.
no means to control no products to sell,
just fear that binds the soul

in time fear spreads
through wires and waves

until the people finally look and ask

what am i afraid of?

in time dust settles,
in time wounds heal,
in time all grinds to a halt.

that fear though?
it persists. it gnaws.
it eats away at the heart of humanity.

it kills humanity.

that humanity that we lose each time we put profit above people
is more valuable than any gold
because without it, we becomes the monsters.

in time that fear will find its way back to the source
the rich, the powerful, the rulers, the binders
and when it does...

one can only
