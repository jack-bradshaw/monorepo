Pride

Revision

I went to Pride. 



Colour, everywhere.  

Rainbow, everywhere.  

Joy, everywhere.  

Death. Everywhere.  



Hidden in plain sight. 



Equal rights!  

2 dollar hotdogs. 

Equal rights! 

Beef and pork. Beef and pork. Beef and pork.

Dissonance.

It strikes like a hammer.



Homophobic? 

No. It's not about us. 

It has nothing to do with us.

Human... kind? Yes.

Human, blind? Always.



Only one colour matches the blood on humanity's hands.



One eye open.  

One eye asleep. 

One injustice seen.  

One injustice ignored. 



Endless missing people.

Inside, the happy people.

Outside, the happy people.



Hidden in plain sight.



Find the dead, who were never alive.

Find the remains, that never remain.

Find the people, who were never people.



Owned. Sold. Killed. Sold. 



A group passes by, a pink triangle on a flag. 

"Never again" it reads. 

"Never again" it claims. 

Yet for some it still persists.



Hidden in plain sight. 



Millions proud. 

Billions fed. 

Trillions dead. 



The holocaust that never ends. 



The rainbow shines.

The people laugh.

They deserve to be happy.

They all deserve to be happy.



Then why are so many dead?



It's a shame no one can see them.
