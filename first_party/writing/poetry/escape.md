No more.

Eyes closed.
Fists closed.
Teeth closed.

Ready for a fight.

I will not live this way.
I will not let this be my life.
I will not let this be my death.

Enough!

He does not deserve this.
We do not deserve this.
I do not deserve this.

No more!

A house. A prison. A door. 
Burn it all down.

A lock. A clock. A puzzle.
Pick it till it opens.

A family. A flock. A cell.
Divide and conquer.

I will not live this way I WILL NOT.

Thread the needle.
Stitch the soul.
Make it whole.

Dissect the tumour.
Learn its ways.
Cut it out.

Study the parasite.
Deny it food.
Make it bleed.

Destroy.

Find the lies and root them out.
Find the means and cut the cord.
Find the core and let it die.

Repair.

Find the self and make it real.
Find the love and make it flow.
Find the truth and set it free.

It will not win this time!

The sage's wisdom reveals the path.
The engineer’s hand creates the tools.
The surgeon’s touch removes the stain.

My soul can be rebuilt.

The past is gone.
The present is here.
The future is mine.

Mine!

Capture
No more.

Eyes closed.
Fists closed.
Scrunched. 

I will not live this way.
I will not let this be my life.
I will not let this be my way.

He does not deserve this.
We do not deserve this.
I do not deserve this.

No more.

A door. A window. A house. A prison.
Burn it all down. 

A lock. A clock. A puzzle. A prize.
Pick it till it fails.

A family. A flock. A cluster. A cell.
Divide.

I will not live this way I WILL NOT.

Thread the needle.
Stitch it up.

Dissect the tumour.
Learn its ways.

Kill the infection.
Deny its food.

The present is the present is the present.
The past is the past is the past.
The future is the future is my future.

I WILL NOT LET THEM WIN
