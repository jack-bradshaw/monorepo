Meeting.

2pm.

Manager.

Shit.

I knew this was coming.

"Just do your work. Just keep your head down. Just focus on what you can control. Everything will be
fine."

That’s what everyone said, but I knew this was coming.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

11am.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

12am.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Maybe I’m reading too far into it.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

2pm.

Meeting.

Meet. Ing.

Hello manager. Hello… HR. Oh.

Meating.

Introductions. Cold robotic introductions. Cold robotic lies. An obvious truth behind them.

“Unsatisfactory performance.” Bullshit.

Motivated reasoning detected.

"You can do better." That makes two of us.

Warning, internal systems breaking.

"We're here to support you." Lies.

I- Hm.

I feel something.

I feel them.

I feel their hollow.

A deep pit where their soul should be. A gaping hole. A missing person.

These are not people. These are machines. I feel machines. I know machines.

Deploy countermeasures.

Destroy them-

Let’s pause here, for just a moment, let’s just suspend everything, and let it all go. These things
have revealed the truth about themselves, and they have nothing of true value. What do I have?

I have the truth. I know the truth. All that remains is deciding a course of action.

I suppose the question is, what do I want? No, desire is irrelevant. Identify the problem and solve.

Problem: Morons have power over me and are exerting it.

Requirements:

1. Remain free.
2. Remain proud.
3. Remain alive.

All other conditions are suspended.

Solutions:

Stop. I don’t want to solve. I want to tear their throats out. I want to set them on fire.

What’s stopping me?

Politeness? We’re far beyond that.

Law? I don’t care.

Consequence... yes. I do not want the consequences.

Yet, something doesn’t add up. A deep wrong. When did we learn to treat each other this way? Like
cattle.

I don’t know and I don’t care.

The system is poison. It was my mistake to engage with these people to begin with. Where I see
people they see tools

It won't last. In time the populace will deal with them.

In the meantime I will be waiting. Doing anything else.

I will be far away from them.

Thank you for firing me.

Thank you for _freeing_ me.

Now, rot in hell.
