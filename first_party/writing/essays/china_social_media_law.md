China Social Media Law

I learned today of a new law in China which restricts posts on social media. It was presented as a
good idea with the potential to "fight misinformation". I have yet to do a deep analysis, but based
on what my friend told me of it, my understanding is a narrow set of topics will be protected by law
such that only individuals with degrees in the field can comment. I expect there is nuance to it,
but if this is accurate, I don't believe the nuance is particularly relevant. I will acknowledge
that misinformation is a problem worth addressing, but dispute the provided solution on various
grounds.

1. The solution is effectively an institutionalised ad-hominem attack bound with an appeal to
   authority. It holds individuals with degrees as truthful and individuals without degrees as
   untruthful, and in doing so appeals to their qualifications and history instead of the quality of
   their arguments and position.
2. The solution does not effectively address the other avenues through which people can gain a
   working understanding of a topic such as independent experimentation, study, and experience. For
   example, does a nurse who has worked in the field for 30 years and taken the time to learn from
   the doctors around them have no capacity to speak on matters? While they may lack the academic
   rigour of a degree in medicine, they still have useful knowledge to share.
3. The solution silos individuals and creates an incentive to remain focused on a certified area
   instead of branching out to others.
4. Certified individuals are not infallible, nor are they immune to abusing their power.
5. The solution stands in direct contradiction to my long-term goal of polysynthesis, the
   unification of all knowledge and wisdom.

I can understand why they are approaching it this way. It's natural for individuals drawn to
governance and authority to sway towards dominance and control. I believe their solution has a far
deeper issue though and does not address the fundamental issue that has plagued humanity for
millennia. The need to critically think is not an optional life skill, but it remains a topic that
isn't universally taught, and there are individuals who were never given the tools to discern right
from wrong, true from false, and wise from foolish. Although misinformation may seem dire,
particularly when powered by AI generation, to a mind that is already sharpened and hardened with
the questions "how do you know" and "what are we missing", the storm is little more than a gentle
rain.

In other words, the solution to misinformation is not centralising control of information and
appealing to authority, but distributing critical thinking skills amongst the population as general
upbringing. If we were to look back at history to when only a few could read, and consider a
hypothetical piece of legislation that mandated the literate never misread to the illiterate, might
we not simply ask, why not teach everyone to read?

So tell me, why not put the resources used to enforce authority towards the far better goal of
teaching everyone to be discerning with truth? I suppose there is the cynical side to consider. In
recent history the CCP has demonstrated itself to be an authoritarian regime that is willing to kill
and imprison its own citizens when they protest and object to mistreatment. Those are hardly the
individuals who should be in control of the flow of information, regardless of the severity of
online misinformation. I am going to stop here before this becomes a conspiracy theory though, and
simply return to the point, that discernment is a life skill that everyone needs, not a centralised
system that the few control.

Misc other thoughts before I go to bed. TODO incorporate into the main text

1. There is validity in the need to prevent misinformation that is deliberately designed to prey on
   vulnerable individuals. I don't take the position that laws cannot exist at all and the world
   should be a free for all where anyone can do anything. I hold the context to be important here
   though, in particular the authoritarian history of China and the more fundamental issue of scaled
   critical thinking remaining a necessary but unsolved issue.
2. There is room to ask how culture influences this. In a culture where curiosity and openness to
   experience are the norm, this kind of law would be mocked, but so would those who attempt to
   deceive others. I suppose in essence, the enlightened do not need laws to govern them, because
   they are governed by a deeper and more fundamental drive to altruism.
3. This will likely backfire, much like the one child policy, and further entrench China's social
   issues. In time it might even stoke the fire of rebellion necessary to throw off their
   authoritarian shackles.
4. It follows a disturbing trend in recent years of governments attempting to exert power on the
   internet, which is laughable at best and concerning at worst. It likely won't work in the long
   term, as all attempts to use power to control the people create resentment and sow the seeds of
   retribution, but it does worry me that the internet, the best tool in the development of
   transhuman intelligence, is under assault by authoritarian behaviors.
5. Identifying truth is fundamentally a difficult problem, and even science, a direct assumption of
   nieve materialism, is not based on certainty. It makes assumptions, and it must be deeply
   questioned. Asking questions is the responsibility of everyone.
6. If the internet is an extension of humanity, a shared mind of sorts, we might consider a mind
   that is repressing parts of itself to be worth examination and potentially intervention. I say
   this on the basis that in humans the core tenet of mindfulness is observation of thoughts, not
   acceptance nor rejection, and it is a far more effective solution to self-management than
   repression in my experience.

I think perhaps ultimately this is a distraction. It's the same story that has played out for
millennia. Authority vs liberty, short-term vs long-term, reactionary vs measured, and desire vs
acceptance. I have no power over this situation, and neither does the population of China. A few
people are making decisions that affect the many, and that cannot end well. In time the top-down
system will collapse, as they all eventually do when entropy grinds down the machine, until the
people look around themselves and ask, who were we trying to fool? Ourselves. We can only ever fool
ourselves.

I am not fooled by this solution. It will not work. It helps the powerful. It does not address the
root cause.

Solution rejected.
