# Council

Council is an experimental multi-agent system where distinct artificial intelligence agents, powered
by Google Gemini models, interact, debate, and vote on various topics. The system uses a
client-server architecture for real-time interaction between agents and a user interface.

## Status

This package is experimental and unreleased; consequently, the API is unstable and subject to change
without notice. Work was suspened to prioritise other projects, and the code is retained for
posterity.

> [!CAUTION] All code in this package was generated by artificial intelligence and has not been
> thoroughly reviewed for quality, security vulnerabilities, or adherence to contributing
> directives. Use in other packages within this repository is strictly prohibited.

## Usage

The server can be started locally using:

```bash
bazel run //first_party/council:council -- --api_key=YOUR_KEY [--port=PORT]
```

Where:

- `api_key` is a Google Gemini API key, optional, if absent, the UI will prompt for it.
- `port` is the port for the web server, optional, if absent, automatically selected.

The web UI will open automatically when the server starts.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

- Server: The [server.py](/first_party/council/server.py) script manages connections and state using
  FastAPI.
- Simulation: The [simulation.py](/first_party/council/simulation.py) script drives agent behavior.
- Agents: The [agent_prompts](/first_party/council/agent_prompts) directory contains agent
  definitions, including personalities and roles.
- Instructions: The [instructions](/first_party/council/instructions) directory contains scenario
  parameters.
- Configuration: The [simulation_config.json](/first_party/council/simulation_config.json) file
  contains global simulation parameters.

## Agents

Various agent personalities have been defined. Most are straightforward workers; however, two are
unique: Ellis and Sille. The former is instructed to step back from the task and focus on coaching
the other agents; whereas, the latter is instructed to coach Ellis and behave as an inner voice. The
efficacy of this approach has not been validated.

## User Interface

The user interface provides the following utilities:

- Agent Dashboard: Displays active agents, their current status (e.g., IDLING, THINKING), sentiment,
  and model information.
- Communication Channels:
  - Group Chat: A real-time feed of public messages exchanged between agents.
  - Private Chats and Thoughts: A stream showing private 1:1 messages and internal agent thoughts.
- Simulation Controls:
  - Start/Pause/Resume: Controls to manage the simulation lifecycle.
  - Filtering: Mechanisms to filter messages by agent or type (Group/Private).
- Advanced Tools:
  - Interjection: Allows the user to inject directives directly to specific agents or the entire
    council.
  - Query: Enables the user to ask questions about the conversation history.
  - Reporting: Generates summaries and reports of the simulation session.

The simulation can be configured by placing an instruction in
[instructions](/first_party/council/instructions) and updating the
[configuration](/first_party/council/simulation_config.json) to use it.

## Future Work

The system is presently unable to produce results that exceed commercially available single-agent
systems (such as Gemini 3.0) and requires further refinement. Next steps would involve:

1. Strategically upgrading agents to more advanced models based on their persona.
1. Creating dynamic sampling windows for each agent based on their persona.
1. Customising the thinking system for each agent instead of simply giving them a different persona
   prompt.
1. Giving each agent the ability to save and restore memories between sessions.
