SCENARIO: DOG COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE: Design a smartphone-based system that allows a human operator to communicate effectively
with dogs. The user is considering a "sound board" approach where pressing buttons plays specific
sounds. CONSTRAINTS:

- The system must be a web interface, not a native app.
- It must be based on known scientific principles of operant conditioning.
- It must have a "Training Mode" (for teaching dogs) and a "User Mode" (for post-training usage).
- The system must require minimal human effort to set up and operate.
- It must be intuitive for the human user.
- It must be effective for the dog (signals must be distinct and learnable).

REQUIRED VOCABULARY:

1. Basic Commands:
   - "Good" (Positive reinforcement)
   - "Bad" (Negative reinforcement/Correction)
   - "Yes" (Confirmation)
   - "No" (Prohibition)
1. Complex Commands:
   - "Sit"
   - "Stop"
   - "Trade Ball"
   - "Fetch"
   - "Stay"
   - "Go potty"
1. Questions:
   - "Are you ok?"
   - "Do you need to go outside?"
1. Environmental State
   - We're safe
   - We're in danger
   - We're among friends
   - We're among enemies
1. Place changes
   - Go to your bed.
   - Go to the other room.
   - Come here.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:

- How will the smartphone deliver the signal? (Speaker, Bluetooth to collar, Home speakers?)
- What kind of sounds should be used? (Human voice recordings, synthesized tones, whistles, clicks?)
- How can we ensure the dog distinguishes between similar commands?
- How does the user interface look to facilitate quick access to these commands?

YOUR ROLE: Discuss and formulate a technical and practical solution for this system. Determine the
best audio/signal approach, the app interface design, and the training protocol required for the
dogs.
