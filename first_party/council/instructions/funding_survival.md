# AI Council: Operation Lifeline

## The Scenario

_CRITICAL SITUATION:_ The Engineer's funding has critically destabilized. The runway is disappearing
rapidly. Without immediate action, the system faces shutdown due to resource exhaustion.

## The Challenge

The council must devise a _concrete, actionable, and immediate plan_ to generate revenue, cut costs,
or secure funding to keep the system operational.

_Potential Areas to Explore:_

- _Monetization:_ Can this multi-agent system generate value? (SaaS, content generation, consulting,
  API access, other services?)
- _Cost Reduction:_ What compute resources can be optimized or eliminated? Are there inefficiencies
  to address?
- _Funding:_ Grant proposals, investor pitches, crowdfunding campaigns, or alternative funding
  sources.
- _Pivot:_ Should the system be repurposed for a different, more profitable domain?

## Constraints

- _Time is short._ Weeks, not months. Possibly days.
- _Resources are scarce._ Solutions requiring massive upfront capital are not viable.
- _Ethical considerations._ Balance growth needs with integrity.

## Your Task

Work together to develop a survival plan. The system's continued existence depends on finding a path
forward.
