# Writing Voice Evolution

Contributing to a shared space requires alignment between contributors to prevent fragmentation and
reduce unnecessary work; however, designing and implementing such agreements is a difficult task
given the inherent subjectivity and complexity of human existence. Rules that are clear to one party
may be vague or unreasonable to another, context can change everything, and employing an objective
third party mediator is not a scalable solution (even with artificial intelligence). A systematic
solution is required.

The first attempt to solve this problem culminated in the creation of a
[General Documentation Standard](https://github.com/jack-bradshaw/monorepo/tree/f5eced9/first_party/standards/general_documentation_standard.md)
which contained 13 prescriptive rules for documentation tone and style: documentation must be
impersonal, objective, precise, formal, literal, current, contractual, terse, descriptive,
definitive, and declarative (amongst other requirements). The intent was clear: establish
unambiguous standards that could be objectively verified and enforced, particularly for
documentation generated by artificial intelligence. It was a work of editorial art, flawless,
sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.

The problem with this approach became apparent over time. While some of the requirements could be
objectively verified and enforced (such as the use of a particular list style in README documents),
the qualities demanded by the General Documentation Standard (objectivity, terseness,
definitiveness) are inherently subjective (ironically) and proved difficult to evaluate, even with
artificial intelligence. More critically, rigid and unyielding adherence to these rules stifled the
very creativity and freedom of expression required to produce high-quality documentation.
Contributors found themselves constrained by rules that often conflicted with each other (be terse
vs. be descriptive, be objective vs. be definitive) with no guidance on how to resolve these
tensions. The rules were easy to list but hard to apply.

Rather than continue to iterate on broken standards, a fundamental shift in the approach was
required. In order to find a balance between rigid rules, general best practices, and subjective
experience, the directives were completely rewritten. Standards were split into three types:
standards (absolute rules), practices (general best practices), and guidelines (subjective
experience). The original "General Documentation Standard" was replaced with
[Writing Voice](documentation/style.md), a document that presents guidelines as dialectical balances
between competing concerns, rather than absolute rigid rules. Instead of demanding that
documentation be "terse", for example, the new document acknowledges the tension between minimalism
(omitting unnecessary detail) and sufficiency (providing enough context), and guides contributors to
strike a balance between the two. All the original standards have been replaced with such
guidelines, and it now offers a far more approachable and useful guide.

This document serves as a historical artifact, chronicling that transformation. It compares the
original prescriptive approach with the current dialectical approach, explaining the rationale for
the transformation and how each original standard maps to the new guidelines. The broader
reorganization effort involved changes to many other documents (e.g. code blocks, tooling,
repository structure, etc.), but this document focuses exclusively on the most complex aspect of
that transformation: the writing voice directives.

## Structural Changes

Before the change:

- 13 standards (Impersonal, Objective, Precise, Formal, Literal, Current, Contractual, Terse,
  Descriptive, Definitive, Declarative)
- 1 minutia section (grammar, verbiage, misc rules)
- Format: Simple directive → example → rationale
- Tone: Absolute requirements ("must")

After the change:

- 11 synthesized guidelines (dialectical structure)
- 1 practice (Scope-Appropriate Documentation)
- Format: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis with examples
- Tone: Guidance and balance ("should strike a balance")

## Philosophical Transformation

Before the change the document presented absolute, non-negotiable rules with no room for context or
judgment.

Example: "All documentation in this repository **must** conform to this standard."

After the change the document acknowledges subjectivity and empowers contributors to make contextual
decisions.

Example: "Contributors should strike a balance between precision (being technically correct) and
accessibility (being easy to understand). Use standard industry terms where specific meaning is
required, but explain them if they are niche; be as simple as possible, but no simpler."

## Mapping: Old Standards → New Guidelines

| Original Standard | New Guideline                           | Transformation                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Impersonal        | Collective Identity                     | Expanded to balance individual vs. collective voice |
| Objective         | Reasoned Wisdom                         | Dialectic: Objectivity vs. Subjectivity (5-step)    |
| Precise           | Balance Precision with Accessibility    | Added accessibility dimension                       |
| Formal            | _(Merged into Precision/Accessibility)_ | Formality absorbed into precision                   |
| Literal           | Balance Abstraction with Clarity        | Reframed: Avoid narrative vs. Use abstraction       |
| Current           | Balance Past, Present, and Future       | Trialectic: Past vs. Present vs. Future             |
| Contractual       | _(Merged into Minimalism/Sufficiency)_  | Implementation details → information density        |
| Terse             | Balance Minimalism with Sufficiency     | Trialectic: Too little vs. Too much vs. Obvious     |
| Descriptive       | _(Merged into Minimalism/Sufficiency)_  | Avoid obvious info → minimalism                     |
| Definitive        | Balance Confidence and Humility         | Dialectic: Confidence vs. Humility                  |
| Declarative       | Balance Declarative and Imperative Tone | Added imperative as valid option                    |
| _(New)_           | Balance Consideration with Respect      | New: Consideration vs. Assumption                   |
| _(New)_           | Balance Judgment with Neutrality        | New: Neutrality vs. Sound Judgment                  |
| _(New)_           | Balance Documentation Distribution      | New: Colocation vs. Fragmentation                   |

The mapping is not perfect, and some original standards do not have direct equivalents in the new
document.

## Key Additions

Several additions were made to the document to address gaps in the original standards.

### Philosophy Section

Before: None

After:

> "Contributing to a shared space requires alignment, but writing is inherently subjective... the
> directives in this document are generally presented as guidelines (not standards or practices)..."

Impact: Sets expectations that these are guidance, not laws.

### Dialectical Structure

The most significant change in the structure of the individual rules was a switch from rigid rules
to dialectical balances. This change was inspired by dialectical behavioural therapy which teaches a
way of thinking that acknowledges the tension between opposing concerns without dismissing one in
favor of the other.

Before: Single-dimensional directives (i.e. must and must-not rules) that favour one polar opposite
(e.g. pure objectivity without room for subjectivity).

After: Multi-dimensional directives using dialectical to balance opposing concerns (e.g. objectivity
balanced with subjectivity).

- 5 single-pole dialectics (balance between 2 extremes)
- 2 multi-pole dialectics (balance between 3 or more extremes)

Impact: Makes competing concerns explicit and teaches contributors to think in terms of balance.

### New Dimensions

The new document covers dimensions that were absent in the original document, specifically:

- Reader empathy (Consideration with Respect)
- Constructive criticism (Judgment with Neutrality)
- Documentation architecture (Documentation Distribution)

These dimensions provide a more complete picture of the writing process and help contributors
consider the needs of their audience. Overall they are more humane and better cater to the inherent
needs of contributors and readers.

## Tone Comparison

Before the change, the document used prescriptive language:

- "must describe"
- "must be used"
- "must be omitted"
- "must adhere"

After the change, the document uses collaborative language:

- "should strike a balance"
- "Contributors should"
- "generally preferring"
- "Use abstraction when..."

This tone change is more than just a shift in language. It is a shift in perspective that
acknowledges the subjectivity of writing, and empowers contributors to make contextual decisions.

## Complexity Analysis

Before the change the directives were 13 rules that were:

- Easy to list
- Hard to apply (conflicts between rules)
- Offered no guidance on how to resolve conflicts
- Eschewed nuance

After the change the guidelines are 11 balanced directives that are:

- Harder to memorize
- Easier to apply (conflicts are resolved within each guideline)
- Offer explicit guidance on balancing competing concerns
- Incorporate nuance

While the new guidelines are more complex, they are also more useful, as they apply better to real
world conditions.

## Linear Independence

Before the change the directives were not linearly independent. For example:

- "Terse" vs. "Contractual" (both about omitting details)
- "Descriptive" vs. "Literal" (both about directness)
- "Objective" vs. "Definitive" (both about certainty)

After the change the guidelines are linearly independent, meaning each guideline operates on a
distinct conceptual dimension without overlap.

## Accessibility Improvements

Before the change the document did not explain why rules existed or acknowledge the difficulty of
adhering to them. This made it hard for contributors to understand the reasoning behind the rules
and how to apply them. After the change the document explains the reasoning behind the rules and
acknowledges the difficulty of adhering to them. This makes it easier for contributors to understand
the reasoning behind the rules and how to apply them.
