# TODO Directives

Directives for TODO comments in this repository.

## Scope

All TODOs in this repository must conform to these directives; however, the contents of
[third_party](/third_party) are explicitly exempt, as they originate from external sources.

## Standard: GitHub Issue Association

TODOs must be associated with a GitHub issue using the format `TODO(#$issue_number): $message`.

Positive example: "`TODO(#123): Write the implementation.`"

Negative example: "`TODO: Write the implementation.`"

This ensures all incomplete work is tracked in a centralized database for auditing and organization.
