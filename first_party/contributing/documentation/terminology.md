# Terminology Standards

Directives for terminology usage in this repository.

## Scope

All documentation and code comments in this repository must conform to these directives.

## Standard: Proper Noun Capitalization

Project names are proper nouns and must be capitalized in all prose, regardless of how they are
cased in code or filenames.

Example:

- **Positive example**: "The Backstab compiler plugin..."
- **Negative example**: "The backstab compiler plugin..."
- **Context**: The file path is `first_party/backstab`, but the project is "Backstab".

Consistency in documentation is a proxy for code quality. Lowercase usage in comments or design docs
degrades the perceived maturity of the project.

## Standard: Adjectival Hyphenation

Compound descriptors using a project name must be hyphenated when used as an adjective.

Example:

- **Positive example**: "Backstab-generated code..."
- **Negative example**: "Backstab generated code..." (Ambiguous: Did Backstab generate the code, or
  did someone backstab the generated code?)
- **Positive example (Alternative)**: "Code generated by Backstab..." (Active voice avoids the
  issue)

Prevents ambiguity about whether the project name is modifying the next word or acting as the
subject/object.
