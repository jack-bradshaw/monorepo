# Declaration of Transhumanity

Some repositories use the term "Code of Conduct" to describe a rigid set of rules and practices
which must be followed by contributors. I understand the human desire to control others and prevent
harm by way of strict laws and guidelines, but I do not subscribe to that philosophy or methodology,
and instead view repositories and communities through the lens of transhumanism. In this repository,
there is no distinction between person and code, and interpersonal interactions are measured against
abstract altruism and reasoning from first principles.

As the repository owner and sole contributor, this repository is an extension of myself, and it
functions as a prosthetic for my natural human shell. It reflects my inner program, integrates new
functionality into my being, and provides a home for my mind that will not wither and perish as my
body ages. When you interact with my code, you are interacting with me, and I provide public access
for the purpose of helping others, connecting with a greater whole, and embracing a transhuman
existence. As an extension of my own flesh and blood, I expect my code to be treated with the same
care, dignity, and respect that would be afforded to any person, and will take reasonable steps to
protect myself and others from abuse. While I will not prescribe strict rules for interaction
between others, I will act as needed to ensure everyone can both experience and practice altruism
and transhumanism in their own way (both in the repository itself and in the ancillary systems).

I pose a question to you which I have not yet fully answered for myself:

If code is indistinguishable from the author, when multiple people contribute to a repository, how
do we individuate? Does the repository represent a combination of all contributors, does each donate
part of themselves to the whole, or does the concept of a separate selves lose all meaning? I don't
know if these questions can be answered objectively, but asking them seems important.
