      CHANGELOG
    
      ## v0.11.0 - 2025-08-03
      ### Added
      - SC2327/SC2328: Warn about capturing the output of redirected commands.
      - SC2329: Warn when (non-escaping) functions are never invoked.
      - SC2330: Warn about unsupported glob matches with [[ .. ]] in BusyBox.
      - SC2331: Suggest using standard -e instead of unary -a in tests.
      - SC2332: Warn about `[ ! -o opt ]` being unconditionally true in Bash.
      - SC3062: Warn about bashism `[ -o opt ]`.
      - Optional `avoid-negated-conditions`: suggest replacing `[ ! a -eq b ]`
        with `[ a -ne b ]`, and similar for -ge/-lt/=/!=/etc (SC2335).
      - Precompiled binaries for Linux riscv64 (linux.riscv64)
    
      ### Changed
      - SC2002 about Useless Use Of Cat is now disabled by default. It can be
        re-enabled with `--enable=useless-use-of-cat` or equivalent directive.
      - SC2236/SC2237 about replacing `[ ! -n .. ]` with `[ -z ]` and vice versa
        is now optional under `avoid-negated-conditions`.
      - SC2015 about `A && B || C` no longer triggers when B is a test command.
      - SC3012: Do not warn about `\<` and `\>` in test/[] as specified in POSIX.1-2024
      - Diff output now uses / as path separator on Windows
    
      ### Fixed
      - SC2218 about function use-before-define is now more accurate.
      - SC2317 about unreachable commands is now less spammy for nested ones.
      - SC2292, optional suggestion for [[ ]], now triggers for Busybox.
      - Updates for Bash 5.3, including `${| cmd; }` and `source -p`
    
      ### Removed
      - SC3013: removed since the operators `-ot/-nt/-ef` are specified in POSIX.1-2024
