# We use `which` to locate the Python interpreter command on PATH. `command -v`
# is another option, but it doesn't check whether the file it finds has the
# executable bit.
#
# A tricky situation happens when this wrapper is invoked as part of running a
# tool, e.g. passing a py_binary target to `ctx.actions.run()`. Bazel will unset
# the PATH variable. Then the shell will see there's no PATH and initialize its
# own, sometimes without exporting it. This causes `which` to fail and this
# script to think there's no Python interpreter installed. To avoid this we
# explicitly pass PATH to each `which` invocation. We can't just export PATH
# because that would modify the environment seen by the final user Python
# program.
