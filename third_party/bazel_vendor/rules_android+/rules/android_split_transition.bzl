"""
Defines the Android Split configuration transition for properly handling native
dependencies

The intended order of checks is:
- If `--android_platforms` is set:
  - Split using the values of this flag as the target platform
  - If this is unset, use the first value from `--platforms`.
    - If this isn't a valid Android platform, an error will be thrown
      during the build.
- Default
  - This will not update the output path to include "-android".
  - Don't split, using the same previously set `--cpu` value.
