# Authoring the docsite

The docsite is a mix of stardoc generated markdown and hand written markdown.  
The files marked with 
```
<!-- *********************
 DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
  It is a generated build output from Stardoc.
  Instead you must edit the .bzl file where the rules are declared,
  or possibly a markdown file next to the .bzl file
 ********************* -->
 ```

Should be edited by modifying the docs in the source `.bzl` files.
