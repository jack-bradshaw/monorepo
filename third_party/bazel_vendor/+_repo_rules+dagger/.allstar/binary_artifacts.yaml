# The bootstrap compiler is needed for an older version of Dagger so that Dagger can build while
# also using Dagger internally.
# The xprocessing jars are there temporarily during the migration to KSP. These will be replaced
# by normal dependencies on xprocessing once the xprocessing APIs stabilize. See b/191911048 and
# b/232152495.
