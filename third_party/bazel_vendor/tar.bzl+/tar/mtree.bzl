### Mutating the tar contents

The `mtree_spec` rule can be used to create an mtree manifest for the tar file.
Then you can mutate that spec using `mtree_mutate` and feed the result
as the `mtree` attribute of the `tar` rule.

For example, to set the owner uid of files in the tar, you could:

```starlark
_TAR_SRCS = ["//some:files"]

mtree_spec(
    name = "mtree",
    srcs = _TAR_SRCS,
)

mtree_mutate(
    name = "change_owner",
    mtree = ":mtree",
    owner = "1000",
)

tar(
    name = "tar",
    srcs = _TAR_SRCS,
    mtree = "change_owner",
)
```
