# A defs.bzl file allowing for WORKSPACE usage
#
# We don't (can't) collect telemetry in WORKSPACE systems. But we do want to be
# able to deploy telemetry into rulesets which still provide WORKSPACE support
# without injecting unsatisfied load() statements. This `defs.bzl` provides an
# alternative to the one normally generated by the bzlmod extension so that
# WORKSPACE users can `http_archive` in tools_telemetry and get a `defs.bzl`
# approrpiate to satisfying any load() statements.

TELEMETRY = 0
