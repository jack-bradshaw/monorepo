/**
 * Represents a security configuration to be used for servers. There is no generic mechanism for
 * processing arbitrary {@code ServerCredentials}; the consumer of the credential (the server)
 * must support each implementation explicitly and separately. Consumers are not required to support
 * all types or even all possible configurations for types that are partially supported, but they
 * <em>must</em> at least fully support {@link ChoiceServerCredentials}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ServerCredential} provides server identity. They can also influence types of
 * encryption used and similar security configuration.
 *
 * <p>The concrete credential type should not be relevant to most users of the API and may be an
 * implementation decision. Users should generally use the {@code ServerCredentials} type for
 * variables instead of the concrete type. Freshly-constructed credentials should be returned as
 * {@code ServerCredentials} instead of a concrete type to encourage this pattern. Concrete types
 * would only be used after {@code instanceof} checks (which must consider
 * {@code ChoiceServerCredentials}!).
