 * automatic discovery, the implementation must have a zero-argument constructor and include
 * a resource named {@code META-INF/services/io.grpc.NameResolverProvider} in their JAR. The
 * file's contents should be the implementation's class name. Implementations that need arguments in
 * their constructor can be manually registered by {@link NameResolverRegistry#register}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <em>should not</em> throw. If they do, it may interrupt class loading. If
 * exceptions may reasonably occur for implementation-specific reasons, implementations should
 * generally handle the exception gracefully and return {@code false} from {@link #isAvailable()}.
